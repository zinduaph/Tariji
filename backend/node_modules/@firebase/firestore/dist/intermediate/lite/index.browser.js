 * commit after 5 attempts, the transaction fails.
 *
 * The maximum number of writes allowed in a single transaction is 500.

 * @param firestore - A reference to the Firestore database to run this
 * transaction against.
 * @param updateFunction - The function to execute within the transaction
 * context.
 * @param options - An options object to configure maximum number of attempts to
 * commit.
 * @returns If the transaction completed successfully or was explicitly aborted
 * (the `updateFunction` returned a failed promise), the promise returned by the
 * `updateFunction `is returned here. Otherwise, if the transaction failed, a
 * rejected promise with the corresponding failure error is returned.
