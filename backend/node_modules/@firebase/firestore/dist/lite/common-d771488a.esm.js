    // whole. Comparing UTF-16 strings in UTF-8 byte order can be done simply and efficiently by
    // comparing the UTF-16 code units (chars). This serendipitously works because of the way UTF-8
    // and UTF-16 happen to represent Unicode code points.
    // After finding the first pair of differing characters, there are two cases:
    // Case 1: Both characters are non-surrogates (code points less than or equal to 0xFFFF) or
    // both are surrogates from a surrogate pair (that collectively represent code points greater
    // than 0xFFFF). In this case their numeric order as UTF-16 code units is the same as the
    // lexicographical order of their corresponding UTF-8 byte sequences. A direct comparison is
    // sufficient.
    // Case 2: One character is a surrogate and the other is not. In this case the surrogate-
    // containing string is always ordered after the non-surrogate. This is because surrogates are
    // used to represent code points greater than 0xFFFF which have 4-byte UTF-8 representations
    // and are lexicographically greater than the 1, 2, or 3-byte representations of code points
    // less than or equal to 0xFFFF.
    // An example of why Case 2 is required is comparing the following two Unicode code points:
    // |-----------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
    // | Name                  | Code Point | UTF-8 Encoding      | UTF-16 Encoding |
    // |-----------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
    // | Replacement Character | U+FFFD     | 0xEF 0xBF 0xBD      | 0xFFFD          |
    // | Grinning Face         | U+1F600    | 0xF0 0x9F 0x98 0x80 | 0xD83D 0xDE00   |
    // |-----------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
    // A lexicographical comparison of the UTF-8 encodings of these code points would order
    // "Replacement Character" _before_ "Grinning Face" because 0xEF is less than 0xF0. However, a
    // direct comparison of the UTF-16 code units, as would be done in case 1, would erroneously
    // produce the _opposite_ ordering, because 0xFFFD is _greater than_ 0xD83D. As it turns out,
    // this relative ordering holds for all comparisons of UTF-16 code points requiring a surrogate

 * A mutation describes a self-contained change to a document. Mutations can

 * the existing version for Set and Patch mutations. For Delete mutations, we
 * reset the version to 0.
 *
 * Here's the expected transition table.

 * explicit update time, we use the commitTime of the WriteResponse for
 * Delete mutations.

 * locally, we transition to an `UnknownDocument` and rely on Watch to send us
