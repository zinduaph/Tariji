(a.k.a. \"UTF-16 code unit\") in the two strings and,\n  // if found, use that character to determine the relative ordering of the two strings as a\n  // whole. Comparing UTF-16 strings in UTF-8 byte order can be done simply and efficiently by\n  // comparing the UTF-16 code units (chars). This serendipitously works because of the way UTF-8\n  // and UTF-16 happen to represent Unicode code points.\n  //\n  // After finding the first pair of differing characters, there are two cases:\n  //\n  // Case 1: Both characters are non-surrogates (code points less than or equal to 0xFFFF) or\n  // both are surrogates from a surrogate pair (that collectively represent code points greater\n  // than 0xFFFF). In this case their numeric order as UTF-16 code units is the same as the\n  // lexicographical order of their corresponding UTF-8 byte sequences. A direct comparison is\n  // sufficient.\n  //\n  // Case 2: One character is a surrogate and the other is not. In this case the surrogate-\n  // containing string is always ordered after the non-surrogate. This is because surrogates are\n  // used to represent code points greater than 0xFFFF which have 4-byte UTF-8 representations\n  // and are lexicographically greater than the 1, 2, or 3-byte representations of code points\n  // less than or equal to 0xFFFF.\n  //\n  // An example of why Case 2 is required is comparing the following two Unicode code points:\n  //\n  // |-----------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n  // | Name                  | Code Point | UTF-8 Encoding      | UTF-16 Encoding |\n  // |-----------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n  // | Replacement Character | U+FFFD     | 0xEF 0xBF 0xBD      | 0xFFFD          |\n  // | Grinning Face         | U+1F600    | 0xF0 0x9F 0x98 0x80 | 0xD83D 0xDE00   |\n  // |-----------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n  //\n  // A lexicographical comparison of the UTF-8 encodings of these code points would order\n  // \"Replacement Character\" _before_ \"Grinning Face\" because 0xEF is less than 0xF0. However, a\n  // direct comparison of the UTF-16 code units, as would be done in case 1, would erroneously\n  // produce the _opposite_ ordering, because 0xFFFD is _greater than_ 0xD83D.

Such a class could,\n * for example, have properties with complex, nested data types, properties used\n * for memoization, properties of types not supported by Firestore (such as\n * `symbol` and `bigint`), and helper functions that perform compound\n * operations. Such classes are not suitable and/or possible to store into a\n * Firestore database. Instead, instances of such classes need to be converted\n * to \"plain old JavaScript objects\" (POJOs) with exclusively primitive\n * properties, potentially nested inside other POJOs or arrays of POJOs. In this\n * context, this type is referred to as the \"DbModel\" and would be an object\n * suitable for persisting into Firestore. For convenience, applications can\n * implement `FirestoreDataConverter` and register the converter with Firestore\n * objects, such as `DocumentReference` or `Query`, to automatically convert\n * `AppModel` to `DbModel` when storing into Firestore, and convert `DbModel`\n * to `AppModel` when retrieving from Firestore.\n *\n * @example\n *\n * Simple Example\n *\n * ```typescript\n * const numberConverter = {\n *     toFirestore(value: WithFieldValue<number>) {\n *         return { value };\n *     },\n *     fromFirestore(snapshot: QueryDocumentSnapshot, options: SnapshotOptions) {\n *         return snapshot.data(options).value as number;\n *     }\n * };\n *\n * async function simpleDemo(db: Firestore): Promise<void> {\n *     const documentRef = doc(db, 'values/value123').withConverter(numberConverter);\n *\n *     // converters are used with `setDoc`, `addDoc`, and `getDoc`\n *     await setDoc(documentRef, 42);\n *     const snapshot1 = await getDoc(documentRef);\n *     assertEqual(snapshot1.data(), 42);\n *\n *     // converters are not used when writing data with `updateDoc`\n *     await updateDoc(documentRef, { value: 999 });\n *     const snapshot2 = await getDoc(documentRef);\n *     assertEqual(snapshot2.data(), 999);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Advanced Example\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // The Post class is a model that is used by our application.\n * // This class may have properties and methods that are specific\n * // to our application execution, which do not need to be persisted\n * // to Firestore.\n * class Post {\n *     constructor(\n *         readonly title: string,\n *         readonly author: string,\n *         readonly lastUpdatedMillis: number\n *     ) {}\n *     toString(): string {\n *         return `${this.title} by ${this.author}`;\n *     }\n * }\n *\n * // The PostDbModel represents how we want our posts to be stored\n * // in Firestore.
